This simple alias will roll to reduce the damage from a missile attack such as a javelin, dart or arrow.  If you add in the amount of damage you took from the attack, it will heal you for the rolled amount or the original damage, which ever is lower.
 
`!gMissileSnaring`  will display the rolled amount you could have healed,
`!gMissileSnaring 12`  will heal your character for the amount you rolled or 12, which ever is lower and will let you know if you caught it (if you reduced the damage to 0).
