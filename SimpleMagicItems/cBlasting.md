An alias for the Circlet of Blasting.
 
`!cBlasting` alone or with targets and casting arguments will create a counter and cast the spell, using the counter rather than a spell slot.
 
Target as normal in combat, using `-rr 3` or `-t` three times to direct each ray.
 
`!cBlasting -t GO1 -t GO2 -t GO2`
or
`!cBlasting -t GO1 -rr 3` just like casting the spell.
