An alias for the Wand of Web.
_ _
`!web` will use a charge and, if you target in init, apply effects just like a normal cast of the spell.
_ _
`!web -i` will ignore a use of the wand.
_ _
`!web -t GO1` will use the wand targeting GO1
_ _
This alias will take all normal casting arguments you can find in `!help cast` that would apply to casting the web spell.
