An alias for the Wand of Web.
 
`!web` will use a charge and, if you target in init, apply effects just like a normal cast of the spell.
 
`!web -i` will ignore a use of the wand.
 
`!web -t GO1` will use the wand targeting GO1
 
This alias will take all normal casting arguments you can find in `!help cast` that would apply to casting the web spell.

The code behind these aliases will be posted as available on my  [Github](https://github.com/TheReverendB/avrae-aliases)
