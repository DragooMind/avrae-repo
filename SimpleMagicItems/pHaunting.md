An alias for the Pipes of Haunting.
 
`!pHaunting` will create the counter for your pipes and display information about it's use.
 
`!pHaunting play [args]` will use the pipes, and when targeted in combat, apply effects.
 
 
Supports target specific arguments as well: `-t "go1|sadv" -t "go2|-sb 5"`
