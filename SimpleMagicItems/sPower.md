An alias for using the Staff of Power.
 
`!sPower "spell name"`  will cast a spell from the staff at the appropriate level.
 
`!sPower "power strike"` will use a charge and deal 1d6[force] damage to a target.
 
`!sPower "retributive strike"` will use all charges and display the damage based on distance and charges remaining.  You will have to apply the damage manually in combat due to the nature of this effect.
