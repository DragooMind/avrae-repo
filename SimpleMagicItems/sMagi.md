Using the Staff of the Magi:
 
Casting spells:
`!sMagi <spell name> [-t targets] [args]`  Available spells: *"conjure elemental", "dispel magic", fireball, "flaming sphere", "ice storm", invisibility, knock, "lightning bolt", passwall, "plane shift", telekinesis, "wall of fire", web*
 
Absorbing spells:
`!sMagi "spell absorption" <level>`  *will tell you if the staff exploded due to overcharging.*
 
Retributive Strike:
`!sMagi "retributive strike"` 
 
This alias will fuzzy match spell names and spell absorption a little.  'light' will cast light but 'lightn' will cast 'Lightning Bolt'.  'absor' or 'spell' will do Spell Absorption but 'absorb' will not since there is only one 'b' in absorption.  Same for 'retri' or 'strike' working for the Retributive Strike feature.
