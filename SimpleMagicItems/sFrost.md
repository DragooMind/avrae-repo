This alias alone will apply the proper resistances to you in initiative, show your remaining charges and also display a reminder for the other commands.
 
After joining init, `!sFrost` will let everyone know you are using the staff, and apply resistance to cold damage to your character.  If you have the staff equipped on your dndbeyond sheet, it will already apply the resistance.  If you choose to cast a spell from the staff, the other commands will also apply the resistance so you can skip this step if you want.
