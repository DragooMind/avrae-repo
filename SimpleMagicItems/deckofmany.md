An alias for the Deck of Many Things!
 
`!deckofmany setup` to set up the deck, include `full` to make it a 22 card deck or leave it off for a 13 card deck.
 
`!deckofmany reset` to reset your current deck.  You can include `full` here too if you want to change it to a 22 card deck or leave it off to switch to 13.
 
Once your deck is set up, run `!deckofmany draw` to draw a card from the deck.
 
Thanks to Derixyleth for the original alias, most of this is their direct work, I only updated a bit of the code to keep it running.
