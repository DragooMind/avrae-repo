An alias for using the Wand of Paralysis.  This creates the counter and rolls for the save and applies an effect if targeted in combat.  Can also be used out of combat, but only for counter tracking.
 
Using the wand:
 
`!wParalysis cast [-t target] [casting args]`  *Remember, for `adv`/`dis` on saves, you use `sadv`/`sdis`*
The wand creates a counter that resets on a long rest but you can also manually recharge it if you are not resting at dawn:
Recharging the wand at dawn:
 
`!wParalysis reset`
 
`!wParalysis` to view instructions and your remaining uses.
