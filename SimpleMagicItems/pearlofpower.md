An alias for the Pearl of Power.
_ _
Restores one expended spell slot of level 3 or lower, choosing the highest level slot possible.
Due to limitations or either my skill or Avrae, this alias will not create a level 3 slot for a warlock that has only higher level slots.  Use it to replace a level 3 or lower slot you have already used.
