Rebinding (renaming) any of these aliases is possible personally or for your server.  I kept the names long so it's obvious what each one does when you view your alias list.
  Basically: `!alias rename oldName newName` or `!servalias rename oldName newName`
 
Thanks to the great people over at [Avrae Discord Server](https://support.avrae.io/) who helped me learn to code these, or donated their aliases to the cause!  If you want to learn, head there.

The code behind these aliases will be posted as available on my [Github](https://github.com/TheReverendB/avrae-aliases)
