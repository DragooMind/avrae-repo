An alias for the Wand of Viscid Globs.
_ _
This alias will create the counter and roll to attack with the wand, applying effects to a target in combat on a hit.  You can use `adv` or `dis` as well as `-b` to add bonuses to hit. 
_ _
`!wViscid [-t target] [-i]`
_ _
Example:
`!wViscid -t GO1 adv`  to target GO1 with advantage
_ _
Update Jan 21, 2023 (been a while!): This alias now uses `eadv` instead of `ea` to match Avrae's commands.

1/27/22 - added support for the `ea` (Elven Advantage) argument for all those elves out there.  Thanks to `Astral Observatory#3378` for bringing it to my attention.
 - also added automatic detection for Halflings who get to reroll 1s
