A snippet for the Clockwork Amulet is now possible thanks to the wonderful contributors to Avrae.
 
`!attack dagger clockwork`  will attack with a dagger using the Clockwork Amulet.
 
`!cast "fire bolt" clockwork`  will cast Fire Bolt, forcing a 10 to-hit using the Clockwork Amulet.
 
Your attack roll will be a forced 10 if you have a use remaining for the amulet.  You can add this snippet to any attack or spell that rolls to hit.
 
You need to have access to Xanathar's Guide to Everything on DnDBeyond.com in order to use this snippet.
