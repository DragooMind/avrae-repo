An alias for using the Staff of the Woodlands.
 
`!sWoodlands "<spell>" [cast arguments] [-i]`. 
 
Creates the counter, casts the spell and uses the counter to keep track. Using `-i`, the staff can be used without expending the charge.
 
You only need to type a unique part of the spell name in order to cast the spell, using quotes for multi-word spells.
Examples of how to use the staff:
 
Barkskin - `!sWoodlands bark [-t target]`
Speak with Animals - `!sWoodlands "with animal"`
Locate Animals or Plants - `!sWoodlands locate`
Wall of Thorns - `!sWoodlands wall [-t target] [-t another] [-dc 14]`
Pass without Trace - `!sWoodlands pass`
Tree Form - `!sWoodlands tree`
Syntax and spells - `!sWoodlands ?` 
 
 
This alias will create a counter that recharges 1d6+4 on long rest. If you use the last charge it will tell you whether the staff loses its properties.
