A simple alias for the Wand of Detect Magic.

`!wDetectMagic` will create a counter, cast the spell and spend a use from the counter.

You can include `-i` to ignore a use, if you need.

That's about it for this one!  Enjoy!

The code behind these aliases will be posted as available on my  [Github](https://github.com/TheReverendB/avrae-aliases)
