__Using the Staff:__
_ _
Lesser Restoration - `!sHealing lesser [-t target]`
_ _
Recharging - `!sHealing recharge` (In case you are adventuring when dawn strikes.)
_ _
This alias will create a counter that resets on a Long Rest.  If you want it to only manually reset, delete your counter ( `!cc delete "Staff of Healing"` ) and create a new counter before using this alias again as follows: `!cc create "Staff of Healing" -min 0 -max 10 -resetby 1d6+4 -type bubble`
