On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.\n\nApplying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of oil of etherealness or universal solvent. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.\n\nIf you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.\n\nA wand of viscid globs is destroyed if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.\nItem: OotA"
