An alias for automating the Staff of Thunder and Lightning!
 
`!sThunderLightning  [lightning | thunder | strike | clap | dual] [-t target(s)] [-i]`
 
Choose your effect and target your enemies!  Partial matching with the above arguments is supported.
Supports target specific args, but not whole group targeting.  Target the combatants individually.
 
`!sThunderLightning lightning [-t target]` - use this after a successful melee attack to apply the extra 2d6[lightning] damage.
 
`!sThunderLightning thunder [-t target]` use this after a successful melee attack to try and stun with thunder.
 
`!sThunderLightning strike [-t target(s)]` use the lightning strike ability of the staff.
  
`!sThunderLightning clap [-t target(s)]` use the thunderclap ability of the staff.
 
`!sThunderLightning dual`  This option only uses the "Thunder and Lightning" counter, then you have to use the `strike` and `clap` attacks with the staff using the `-i` argument to ignore uses.  This was the best option for this since both actions would effect different targets.
