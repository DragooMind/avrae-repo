An alias for the Wand of Lightning Bolts.  Inspired by @Tyverion, long may he reign.
 
**Use**:
 
`!wLightningBolts <charges used> [-t target(s)]`
 
If you already have a counter for this wand, I suggest deleting it (`!cc delete "Wand of Lightning Bolts"`) since counters can now roll to recharge on a Long Rest as a built in function of Avrae, which this alias will create for you.

The code behind these aliases will be posted as available on my  [Github](https://github.com/TheReverendB/avrae-aliases)
