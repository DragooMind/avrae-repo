An alias for the Wand of Lightning Bolts.  Inspired by @Tyverion, long may he reign.
_ _
**Use**:
_ _
`!wLightningBolts <charges used> [-t target(s)]`
_ _
If you already have a counter for this wand, I suggest deleting it (`!cc delete "Wand of Lightning Bolts"`) since counters can now roll to recharge on a Long Rest as a built in function of Avrae, which this alias will create for you.
