# avrae-aliases
Aliases and Automations by thereverendb (and others) for use with the Avrae Discord bot.

These aliases and automations are shared here to help others learn how to use Avrae to her maximum potential.  I've learned a lot on the [Avrae Development Server](https://support.avrae.io) and am happy to share this knowledge with you.

The [Simple Magic Items](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5f8ae71ebbee1bca82ad38d2) Collection is (I think) my most useful collection, but feel free to check out some of the other code I store here as well.

It's not all great stuff, but it does seem to get the job done.  Interesting to see how my style has changed over the few years I've been doing this.
