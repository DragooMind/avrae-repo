An alias for using the Mizzium Apparatus.  This will make the Arcana roll and cast the spell all in one go.

**Now with partial spell name matching!**
Keep in mind you are matching spells against all official 5e spells so you will still need to be pretty specific.  Also important to use double quotes around the spell name - especially if there is an apostrophe in the spell name.

`!mizapp "spell name" [spell args]`

If you need to add modifiers to your Arcana roll, you can add them after an `*` in the arguments like this:

`!mizapp "fire bolt" dis -t go1 * adv`

This will cast "fire bolt" with disadvantage to hit go1, but with advantage on your Arcana roll to use the Mizzium Apparatus.

Will now automatically add a 1d4 bonus for Mark of Making Humans and Veldakins can add the `precision` argument for a 1d4 bonus if they chose Arcana as their Tireless Precision skill.
